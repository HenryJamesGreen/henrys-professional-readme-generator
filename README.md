## Installation
N/A

## Usage
To generate a new README file, to be stored in the 'generated-readmes' folder, simply access the terminal through VS code, ensure you are on the correct directory and type 'node index.js'. After pressing the 'enter' key, you will be prompted to answer a number of questions relating to the content of your custom README, including project title, installation details, a choice of licenses (or none if you prefer) and your GitHub username and email. Once completed, a new, custom README will be generated and stored in the aforementioned folder, complete with the details you provided, as well as a link to your gitHub profile, email and a clickable table of contents. You will also see, if chosen, the relevant badge belonging to the license of your choosing.
